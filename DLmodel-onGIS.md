# DL Computer Vision Model with ArchGIS Application
Objective:
- Develop an in-house computer vision process to extract feature information from aerial imagery datasets (RGB, NIR, and Lidar) with an integration of the DeepLearning Model and a GIS mapping system to extract building footprints and canopy trees from the data.
- Improve an image extraction performance compared to a traditional GIS platform like ENVI, the supervised machine learning workflow involves defining ROIs, stacking spectral layers, and cleaning up the classification output to reduce noise. This process is time-consuming and less accurate.

  
Software Requirement:
- ArcGIS deep learning module (arcgis.learn)
- Python API
- NVIDIA (CUDA) GPU processor
