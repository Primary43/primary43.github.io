# Customer-Segmentation-Prediction @ KPMG Virtual Internship

To understand customer value among a group of new customers lacking transaction history, different supervised classification ML and DL models were developed and assessed.

- 1.1 Initially, an engineered target was obtainedâ€”a segmentation derived from the cluster of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) model analyzing the behavior of existing customers with transaction records.

- 1.2 Among different supervised classification ML and DL models, Two-Step Deep learning Classification Approach has proven to be more effective than the multi-classification approach, which has encountered challenges in accurately predicting each class in this given problem, compared to the model baseline (multi-classification deep learning model), Decision Tree, KNeighborsClassifier, EnsembleVoting model.

- 1.3 Explainable AI (XAI) was applied to provide a clear view of each feature's influence on a prediction, indicating whether it raises or lowers the likelihood of a particular outcome. This includes the utilization of ExplainableDashboard and Dalex libraries.

### 3. Web application and model prediction

Deployed using Dash/Flask on Heroku for the capability of real-time prediction for both new input and existing customers based on demographic data.
