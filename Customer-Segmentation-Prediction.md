# Customer-Segmentation-Prediction @ KPMG Virtual Internship

To understand customer value among a group of new customers lacking transaction history, different supervised classification ML and DL models were developed and assessed.
Business Use Case:
- The predicted segmentation can lead to more personalized marketing strategies, and improved customer engagement.
- Targeted promotions and incentives that resonate with each group's behavior and preferences can be used for potentially increasing customer lifetime value and loyalty.

### 3. Model Development

- 3.1 Initially, an engineered target was obtainedâ€”a segmentation derived from the cluster of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) model analyzing the behavior of existing customers with transaction records.

  The result reveals low correlations between RFM clusters and other features, suggesting non-linear relationships. Facing challenges in identifying the underlying characteristics of the target RFM cluster, we implemented supervised learning algorithms to discern patterns and classify the target clusters.

- 3.2 Among different supervised classification ML and DL models, Two-Step Deep learning Classification Approach has proven to be more effective than the multi-classification approach, which has encountered challenges in accurately predicting each class in this given problem, compared to the model baseline (multi-classification deep learning model), Decision Tree, KNeighborsClassifier, EnsembleVoting model.

- 3.3 Explainable AI (XAI) was applied to provide a clear view of each feature's influence on a prediction, indicating whether it raises or lowers the likelihood of a particular outcome. This includes the utilization of ExplainableDashboard and Dalex libraries.

### 5. Web application and model prediction

Deployed using Dash/Flask on Heroku for the capability of real-time prediction for both new input and existing customers based on demographic data.
