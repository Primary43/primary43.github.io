# Customer-Segmentaion-Prediction-@kpmg-s-virtual-internship
To understand customer value among a group of new customers lacking transaction history, different supervised classification ML and DL models were developed and assessed.

## Final WebApp on Heroku: https://app-db1-5d66c8de929e.herokuapp.com/

### 1. Model Development: 
https://github.com/Primary43/kpmg-s-virtual-internship/blob/main/ModelDevelopment/Module_2_kpmg_slide.pdf
- 1.1 Initially, an engineered target was obtainedâ€” a segmentation derived from the cluster of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) model analyzing the behavior of existing customers with transaction records.

- 1.2 Among different supervised classification ML and DL models, Two-Step Deep learning Classification Approach has proven to be more effective than the multi-classification approach, which has encountered challenges in accurately predicting each class in this given problem, compared to the model baseline (multi-classification deep learning model), Decision Tree, KNeighborsClassifier, EnsembleVoting model.

- 1.3 Explainable AI (XAI) was applied to provide a clear view of each feature's influence on a prediction, indicating whether it raises or lowers the likelihood of a particular outcome. This includes the utilization of ExplainableDashboard and Dalex libraries

### 3. Web application and model prediction:
were deployed using Dash/ Flask on Heroku for the capability of real-time prediction for both new input and existing customers based on demographic data.
